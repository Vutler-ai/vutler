# Vutler State

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25 16:34 GMT+1  
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 (Dashboard Layout)  
**Current Sprint:** Sprint 7  
**Milestone:** Next.js Foundation

---

## Current Status

✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Next.js project scaffolded and verified

**What just happened:**
- Created Next.js 15 project with all modern tooling
- Configured Vutler brand colors and dark theme
- Built typed API client for backend integration
- Verified production build works
- Documented project structure

**Ready for:**
- Phase 2: Building dashboard layout and UI components

---

## Active Decisions

### Technology Choices
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router) ✅
- **Language:** TypeScript ✅
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 ✅
- **Components:** shadcn/ui ✅
- **Font:** Inter (self-hosted) ✅
- **State Management:** React Query (planned for Phase 3)
- **Real-time:** WebSocket (planned for Phase 8)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Output Mode:** Standalone (for Docker optimization) ✅
- **API Client:** Singleton pattern with typed methods ✅
- **Theme:** Dark theme as default, no toggle (for now) ✅
- **Routing:** App Router with file-based routing ✅

### Deployment Strategy
- **Build:** Multi-stage Docker image ✅
- **Runtime:** Node 20 Alpine ✅
- **User:** Non-root (nextjs:nodejs) for security ✅
- **Proxy:** Nginx reverse proxy (Phase 7)
- **SSL:** Let's Encrypt (Phase 7)

## Blockers

**None currently**

## Open Questions

1. **Agent creation flow:** Modal vs dedicated page?
   - *Leaning toward modal for faster UX*

2. **Agent list layout:** Table vs card grid?
   - *Table for desktop, cards for mobile?*

3. **RocketChat integration:** Iframe embed vs custom UI?
   - *Defer to Phase 9, need to test both approaches*

4. **Authentication:** Build custom or use NextAuth.js?
   - *Defer to Phase 10, need backend auth strategy first*

5. **Real-time updates:** WebSocket vs polling vs SSE?
   - *WebSocket preferred, but need backend support*

## Technical Notes

### Build Warnings
- ⚠️ Next.js Turbopack warning about multiple lockfiles (expected, safe to ignore)
- ✅ Build completes successfully with standalone output
- ✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✅ All dependencies installed (360 packages)

### Environment Configuration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` must be set before build for production
- Default dev value: `http://localhost:3001`
- Production value: `https://api.vutler.ai` or internal VPS URL

### Docker Notes
- Health check endpoint needs to be implemented in Phase 2
- Standalone output reduces image size significantly
- Non-root user prevents security issues in production

---

## Next Actions

1. **Commit Phase 1 work** (atomic commit per GSD methodology)
2. **Start Phase 2** - Dashboard layout
   - Add shadcn components (Button, Card, etc.)
   - Create sidebar navigation
   - Build dashboard page skeleton
3. **Create `.planning/02-CONTEXT.md`** if needed for layout decisions

---

## Git Status

**Branch:** main (or feature branch TBD)  
**Last Commit:** None yet (scaffold work uncommitted)  
**Pending Commits:**
- `feat(phase-01): scaffold Next.js project with Vutler branding`

---

## Dependencies Status

### Backend API Availability
- ✅ Express API running on port 3001 (assumed)
- ✅ RocketChat running on port 3000 (assumed)
- ⚠️ Need to verify API endpoints return expected data shape

### Frontend Dependencies
- ✅ All npm packages installed
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ TypeScript configured correctly

---

## Performance Considerations

- Standalone build optimizes bundle size
- Image optimization configured (AVIF, WebP)
- Source maps disabled for production
- Font loaded locally (no external request to Google)

---

## Security Notes

- Non-root Docker user configured
- No sensitive files in Docker build (`.dockerignore`)
- Environment variables not committed (`.gitignore`)
- API client uses type-safe methods (prevents injection)

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **GSD Methodology Applied:**
   - Created structured planning docs
   - Following atomic commit strategy
   - Keeping context modular and clean

2. **Next.js 15 Specifics:**
   - Turbopack is fast but shows lockfile warnings
   - Standalone output is essential for Docker
   - App Router requires different patterns than Pages Router

3. **shadcn/ui:**
   - Tailwind v4 integration works smoothly
   - Components will be copied into project (not npm package)
   - Dark theme configured via CSS variables

---

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 complete, ready for Phase 2  
**Next Milestone:** Phase 2 completion (Dashboard Layout)
