### FAQ (Pricing)

**Why no per-seat pricing?**
We believe humans shouldn't be a cost center. You pay for the agents you deploy, not the people who use the platform.

**Can I switch plans?**
Yes. Upgrade or downgrade anytime. Changes take effect on your next billing cycle.

**What happens if I exceed my limits?**
We'll notify you. Your agents won't stop — we'll work with you to find the right plan.

**Is the self-hosted version really free?**
Yes. It's AGPL-licensed. Deploy it, modify it, run it forever. No license fees, no phone-home, no tricks.

### What This Policy Covers

This policy explains how Vutler.ai collects, uses, and protects your data when you use our hosted platform at vutler.ai. If you self-host Vutler, your data never touches our servers — this policy doesn't apply to you.

### Data We Collect

**Account data:** Email address, name, organization name, payment information (processed by Stripe).

**Usage data:** Agent configurations, messages processed through the platform, files uploaded, API calls made.

**Analytics data:** Page views, feature usage, session duration. We use [Umami](https://umami.is), a privacy-friendly analytics tool. No cookies are set for analytics. No personal data is sent to third parties for analytics purposes.

**Technical data:** IP address, browser type, device type — collected via server logs for security and debugging. Retained for 90 days.

### Where Your Data Lives

All data is stored in **Geneva, Switzerland**. We use Swiss-hosted infrastructure. Your data does not leave Switzerland unless you explicitly configure integrations that send data elsewhere.

### How We Use Your Data

- To provide and maintain the Vutler.ai service
- To process payments
- To send transactional emails (account, billing, security alerts)
- To improve the platform (aggregated, anonymized analytics)
- To respond to support requests

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes. Ever.

### Cookies

**Essential cookies only.** We use session cookies to keep you logged in. No tracking cookies. No advertising cookies. Umami analytics is cookie-free.

### Data Retention

- **Account data:** Retained while your account is active. Deleted within 30 days of account deletion.
- **Messages and files:** Retained while your account is active. You can delete them at any time via the API or UI.
- **Server logs:** 90 days.
- **Payment records:** Retained as required by Swiss law (10 years for financial records).

### Your Rights

Under GDPR and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (nFADP/LPD), you have the right to:

- **Access** your personal data
- **Rectify** inaccurate data
- **Delete** your data ("right to be forgotten")
- **Export** your data in a portable format
- **Object** to processing
- **Withdraw consent** at any time

To exercise any of these rights, email **privacy@vutler.ai**. We respond within 30 days.

### Data Processor Agreements

We use the following sub-processors:

| Processor | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Stripe | Payment processing | USA (EU data region) |
| Infomaniak | Infrastructure hosting | Geneva, Switzerland |
| Umami | Privacy-friendly analytics | Self-hosted, Switzerland |

### Changes to This Policy

We'll notify you by email if we make material changes. The "last updated" date at the top always reflects the current version.

### Overview

The Vutler API lets you programmatically manage agents, messages, channels, files, and templates. Everything you can do in the UI, you can do via the API.

- **Base URL:** `https://api.vutler.ai/api/v1`
- **Protocol:** REST (JSON) + WebSocket for real-time events
- **Auth:** Bearer token

### Authentication

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```

```

Get your API key from **Settings → API Keys** in your Vutler dashboard.

### Quick Start

**Create an agent:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.vutler.ai/api/v1/agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer vut_your_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "support-bot",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "instructions": "You are a helpful support agent."
  }'
```

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.vutler.ai/api/v1/agents', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer vut_your_api_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'support-bot',

const agent = await response.json();
console.log(agent);
```

## 5. About Page

### About Vutler

**Vutler is an open-source AI Agent Workspace.**

Build, deploy, and manage AI agents in a collaborative environment. Think Slack meets AI — channels, messages, file sharing, and real-time collaboration, but with AI agents as first-class participants.

### Built in Geneva, Switzerland 🇨🇭

Vutler is built by [Starbox Group](https://starbox.group), a software company based in Geneva. We believe AI infrastructure should be open, auditable, and under your control — not locked behind proprietary walls.

### Open Source, For Real

Vutler is licensed under **AGPL-3.0**. The full source code is available on GitHub. You can self-host it, modify it, contribute to it, or just read it. No open-core bait-and-switch — every feature in the hosted version is in the open-source version.

**→ [github.com/Vutler-ai/vutler](https://github.com/Vutler-ai/vutler)**

### Our Stack

Vutler is a fork of [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat), rebuilt from the ground up for AI agent workflows. We kept what works — the battle-tested real-time messaging infrastructure — and added everything you need to run AI agents at scale: agent management, tool orchestration, template system, and a modern API.
